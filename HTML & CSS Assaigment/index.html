            <h3>My adventure in Vrindavan</h3>
            <p>I recently fulfilled my dream of visiting Vrindavan! This fascinating place is truly a land of extremes -  also known as the “temple of divine love” is a Hindu temple in Vrindavan, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. It was established by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj (the fifth original Jagadguru) in 2001 and inaugurated in 2012 for the general public. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made out of Italian white marble and adorned with exquisite carvings, this temple is also known for its architectural beauty.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    You will be amazed by the intricately carved doors and windows of the temple. Surrounded by beautiful fountains and gardens, the temple has a life-size depiction of four leelas of Shri Krishna – Jhulan Leela, Govardhan Leela, Raas Leela, and Kaliya Naag Leela.

                    Chandeliers beautifully light up the entire temple. The lighting of Prem Mandir changes color every five minutes and is indeed a site to behold.

Figures of Shri Krishna and Rasik saints depicting the important events surrounding the Lord’s existence cover the walls of the main temple.

            <h3>My adventure in Uttarakhand</h3>
            <p>Kedarnath Dham, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, is one of the most paramount locations for worshipers of Shiva. The air appears to be reverberating with the name of Lord Shiva amid the mighty snow-clad peaks, enchanting meadows and forests of the lower mountain range of Himalayas. Situated in a breathtaking location, near the source of Mandakini River and at the height of 3,584 meters, Kedarnath Dham celebrates the greatness of Lord Shiva. Kedarnath temple is one of the 12 Jyotir Lingams and is also the most important temple among the Panch Kedars (group of 5 Shiva temples in Garhwal Himalayas). It is also one of the significant temples of the sacred Chota Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand, raising the glory of the place to further heights.</p>

                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        According to Hindu mythology, the temple was built by the Pandavas, the legendary heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. As per legends, after the great Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas wanted to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva to atone for their sins. However, Lord Shiva was not pleased with them and refused to meet them. The Pandavas then followed him to the Himalayas, where he took refuge in the form of a bull. The Pandavas then built temples at the sites to worship Lord Shiva in his bull form where they found the body parts of the bull. Kedarnath Temple was the site where the hump of the bull was seen. The current temple is believed to have been built by Adi Shankara in the 8th century CE. However, the temple has undergone several renovations over the centuries due to damage caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes and avalanches. The current structure is believed to have been built in the 19th century.

                        The opening and closing dates of the Kedarnath Temple are decided by the priests based on the auspicious dates in the Hindu calendar. The dates are generally announced on Mahashivratri, in February. Generally, the temple opens in the last week of April or the first week of May and closes in the second week of November.
